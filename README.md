# Codeblocks- C++ - 4skills - Training framework


Add your breakpoints in the code (better over the function you want to call), you may also extend examples

Note: cb-cpp-4skills-training-part1 to cb-cpp-training-part7, that will be increasingly added

@Credits: To Dr. Mostafa Assaf (Udemy) 4Skills course.
